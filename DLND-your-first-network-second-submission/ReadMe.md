Your First Neural Network

Introduction

In this project, I built a neural network to perform a prediction problem on a real bike sharing dataset from UCI machine learning database!

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

Instructions:

1. Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with 
```git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git```.Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, 
so it's the best place to get the project files.
2. cd into the ```first-neural-network``` directory.
3. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
4. Create a new conda environment:
```conda create --name dlnd python=3```
5. Enter your new environment:
   ```Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd```
   ```Windows: >> activate dlnd```
6. Ensure you have ```numpy```, ```matplotlib```, ```pandas```, and ```jupyter notebook``` installed by doing the following:
   ```conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook```
7. Run the following to open up the notebook server:
   ```jupyter notebook```
8. In your browser, open ```Your_first_neural_network.ipynb```
9. Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the ```my_answers.py``` python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook and have taken a look at the rubric before you submit the project!
