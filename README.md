Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

Core Curriculum ([Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)):

This repository consists of all the lessons and projects I needed to complete in order to receive my certificate.

LIST OF COMPLETED 5 PROJECTS:

1. PART 1:

   Neural Networks:
   
   This was my first neural network project where I predicted bike sharing data.

   Project: [Your first neural network](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/udacity-deep-learning/tree/master/DLND-your-first-network-second-submission)

2. PART 2:

   Convolutional Neural Networks:

   In this project, I classified images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 

   Project: [Image Classification](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/udacity-deep-learning/tree/master/dlnd_image_classification.ipynb.2)

3. PART 3:

   Recurrent Neural Networks:

   Project: [Generate TV Scripts](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/udacity-deep-learning/tree/master/dlnd_tv_script_generation_1st)
   
   Project: [Translation Project](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/udacity-deep-learning/tree/master/dlnd_language_translation_1st)

4. PART 4:

   Generative Adversarial Networks:

   Project: [Generate Faces](https://github.com/ozgurpolat/udacity-deep-learning/tree/master/dlnd_face_generation_1)
